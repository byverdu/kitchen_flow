## Kitchen Workflow explained in a TDD way.
==========================================

Due to my background related with the hospitality I believe that I can explain the work flow in a restaurant.

My experience is mainly on the kitchen but I know all the required steps.

Lets bake a little bit.

## Technologies used:

1. Ruby
2. RSpec

## How to use it.

```ruby

# Clone/download/fork the repo

cd path/to/folder

irb

require './lib/loader'

# all classes ready to use

```
